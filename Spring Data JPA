Spring Data JPA 
=================================
This is part of the umbrella Spring Data project that makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories.
Features:

Sophisticated support to build repositories based on Spring and JPA
Support for QueryDSL predicates and thus type-safe JPA queries
Transparent auditing of domain class
Pagination support, dynamic query execution, ability to integrate custom data access code
Validation of @Query annotated queries at bootstrap time
Support for XML based entity mapping
JavaConfig based repository configuration by introducing @EnableJpaRepositories

>>>> Difference between CrudRepository and JpaRepository interfaces

Very basic difference is JpaRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository which in turn extends CrudRepository.

Their main functions are:

>> CrudRepository mainly provides CRUD functions.
>> PagingAndSortingRepository provide methods to do pagination and sorting records.
>> JpaRepository provides some JPA related method such as flushing the persistence context and delete record in a batch.

Because of the inheritance mentioned above,  JpaRepository will have all the functions of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository. So if you don't need the repository to have the functions provided by JpaRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository , use CrudRepository.
