1) What is the difference between Spring Boot and the Spring framework?

If Spring is the cake, Spring Boot is the icing.

In short, Spring framework helps you build web applications. It takes care of dependency injection, handles transactions, implements an MVC framework and provides foundation for the other Spring frameworks (including Spring Boot)

While you can do everything in Spring without Spring Boot, Spring Boot helps you get things done faster:

simplifies your Spring dependencies, no more version collisions
can be run straight from a command line without an application container
build more with less code - no need for XML, not even web.xml, auto-configuration
useful tools for running in production, database initialization,  environment specific config files, collecting metrics
