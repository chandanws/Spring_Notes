1) What is the difference between Spring Boot and the Spring framework?

If Spring is the cake, Spring Boot is the icing.

In short, Spring framework helps you build web applications. It takes care of dependency injection, handles transactions, implements an MVC framework and provides foundation for the other Spring frameworks (including Spring Boot)

While you can do everything in Spring without Spring Boot, Spring Boot helps you get things done faster:

simplifies your Spring dependencies, no more version collisions
can be run straight from a command line without an application container
build more with less code - no need for XML, not even web.xml, auto-configuration
useful tools for running in production, database initialization,  environment specific config files, collecting metrics


2) What is difference between spring MVC and spring boot?

Spring MVC and Spring Boot are exist for the different purpose. So, it is not wise to compare each other as the contenders.

What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a framework for packaging the spring application with sensible defaults. What does this mean?. You are developing a web application using Spring MVC, Spring Data, Hibernate and Tomcat. How do you package and deploy this application to your web server. As of now, we have to manually write the configurations, XML files, etc. for deploying to web server.
Spring Boot does that for you with Zero XML configuration in your project. Believe me, you don't need deployment descriptor, web server, etc. Spring Boot is magical framework that bundles all the dependencies for you. Finally your web application will be a standalone JAR file with embeded servers.
If you are still confused how this works, please read about microservice framework development using spring boot.

What is Spring MVC?
It is a traditional web application framework that helps you to build web applications. It is similar to Struts framework.
